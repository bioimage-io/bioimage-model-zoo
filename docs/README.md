# BioImage Model Zoo: Advanced AI models in one-click

Bioimage Model Zoo has been created by 5 founding partners: ilastik, ImJoy, Fiji, DeepImageJ and ZeroCostDL4Mic with the aim to establish a single specification and a single distribution point for deep learning models trained to perform bioimage analysis tasks. Our vision is to define a “common core” which would allow all networks in the Zoo to be compatible with community partner tools. Such compatibility will ensure that the networks of the Zoo can truly be used by non-computational biologists through user-friendly tools we are developing as our main job. 

Obviously, the Zoo is not just the model format. We aim to make cutting-edge AI technology accessible to our users and to this end provide detailed model descriptions and search, automatic testing of all submitted models, quick online try-out of the models on small data samples, transparent links to source code, training data and notebooks, etc. The Zoo is open to submissions from outside, we will do our best to ensure you have a smooth experience contributing your work which will of course remain in your IP with all necessary attributions.
