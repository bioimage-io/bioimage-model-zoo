# How-To use bioimage.io 

## DeepImageJ

TBD

## Fiji
**Note: Fiji only supports Tensorflow 1 models at the moment!**

1. Install the [CSBDeep-Plugin](https://github.com/CSBDeep/CSBDeep_website/wiki/CSBDeep-in-Fiji-%E2%80%93-Installation) in Fiji.
This will give you all the necessary Plugins to run bioimage.io models at the moment.
2. Open the image you want to run the model on
3. a) If your model is a [CSBDeep](https://imagej.net/CSBDeep) one, go to Plugins > CSBDeep and choose either "N2V", "DenoiSeg" or "Run your network"(default)
   
   b) For any other bioimage.io model, go to Plugins > bioimage.io > bioimage.io prediction. 
4.  Continuing from 3b) you will arrive at this window:

<img src="user_guide/fiji_bioimage_predict.jpg" alt="Fiji bioimage.io prediction" width="60%"/>

The configuration fields should be self-explanatory.

5. Click "OK" to run the model prediction.
